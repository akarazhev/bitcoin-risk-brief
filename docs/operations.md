# Operations

## Local Environment

Create a local environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Validate compose:

```bash
./scripts/manage.sh validate
```

Start services:

```bash
./scripts/manage.sh start
```

Apply schema to an existing database:

```bash
./scripts/manage.sh migrate
```

Import the canonical CSV without network access:

```bash
./scripts/manage.sh backfill
```

Refresh from CoinMarketCap if configured, then import the full CSV:

```bash
./scripts/manage.sh run-now
```

If `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` is empty, `run-now` imports the existing canonical CSV and recomputes risk without remote
network refresh.

## Planned Downloaded CSV Refresh

Production-pilot operation should support refreshing BTC history from a CSV downloaded by an operator from:

```text
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/
```

That workflow is not a replacement for validation. The import command should stage the downloaded file, normalize it to
the canonical CSV schema, reject gaps or incompatible columns, atomically replace `collector/btc-csv/btc_usd_daily.csv`
only after validation passes, and then run the normal database import/readiness checks.

Until that workflow exists, operators should treat `collector/btc-csv/btc_usd_daily.csv` as the canonical source and use
`./scripts/manage.sh backfill` or `./scripts/manage.sh run-now` to import it.

Open the app:

```text
http://localhost:3001
```

## Service Logs

Follow all logs:

```bash
./scripts/manage.sh logs
```

Follow a single service:

```bash
./scripts/manage.sh logs backend
./scripts/manage.sh logs data-collector
./scripts/manage.sh logs frontend
./scripts/manage.sh logs timescaledb
```

## Health and Readiness

Basic health:

```bash
curl -fsS http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

Production readiness:

```bash
curl -fsS http://localhost:3001/api/readiness
```

Readiness should be used for deployment probes and monitoring alerts.

## Backups

Create a timestamped backup of PostgreSQL and the canonical BTC CSV:

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh
```

Preview the target paths without touching the database:

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh --dry-run
```

Production defaults can be controlled from the environment:

```bash
BACKUP_DIR=./backups BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=30 ./scripts/backup.sh
```

Each backup directory contains:

- compressed PostgreSQL custom-format `pg_dump` output;
- a copy of `collector/btc-csv/btc_usd_daily.csv`;
- `manifest.txt` with source metadata;
- `SHA256SUMS` for integrity checks.

Backups should be copied off the server. Keeping the only backup under `./backups` protects against accidental database edits, but not against disk failure.

## Restore Notes

Restore only into a staging copy or an intentionally empty production database:

```bash
podman-compose -f podman-compose.yml exec -T timescaledb pg_restore --clean --if-exists --no-owner --no-privileges -U postgres -d bitcoin_risk_brief < backups/<timestamp>/postgres_<timestamp>.dump
cp backups/<timestamp>/btc_usd_daily_<timestamp>.csv collector/btc-csv/btc_usd_daily.csv
./scripts/manage.sh run-now
curl -fsS http://localhost:3001/api/readiness
```

Take the public app offline before restoring production data. TimescaleDB may print circular foreign-key warnings during backup; treat them as informational only when `scripts/backup.sh` exits with code 0.

## Database Checks

Check latest source/risk coverage:

```bash
podman-compose -f podman-compose.yml exec timescaledb   psql -U postgres -d bitcoin_risk_brief -t -A -c   "SELECT max(timestamp)::date, count(*) FROM btc_ohlcv_daily; SELECT max(timestamp)::date, count(*) FROM btc_risk_daily;"
```

Check validation source:

```bash
podman-compose -f podman-compose.yml exec timescaledb   psql -U postgres -d bitcoin_risk_brief -t -A -c   "SELECT validation_json->>'source', validation_json->'validation'->>'source_strategy', row_count FROM btc_risk_validation WHERE validation_key='latest';"
```

## Common Troubleshooting

### Readiness is degraded

Inspect `/api/readiness` and check which flag failed. Common causes:

- collector has not run;
- data is older than `DATA_FRESHNESS_MAX_AGE_DAYS`;
- validation source is not `coinmarketcap_csv`;
- latest risk timestamp does not match validation coverage end.

### Collector skips remote refresh

If `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` is empty, this is expected. The collector still imports the existing CSV and recomputes risk.

### Collector fails on remote delta

A non-contiguous CoinMarketCap delta is rejected without rewriting the CSV. Inspect `data-collector` logs and rerun after the upstream data issue is resolved.

### TimescaleDB connection race

The collector wraps pool creation in retry logic, but if the database is unhealthy for longer than the retry window, fix the database container first:

```bash
podman-compose -f podman-compose.yml ps
podman-compose -f podman-compose.yml logs timescaledb
```

## Stopping Services

```bash
./scripts/manage.sh stop
```

This stops containers but keeps `./data/timescaledb` on disk.
